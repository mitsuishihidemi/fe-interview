## Cleo Frontend Interview - Bills

### Overview

I choose the option 2 to make my take home test, but it took me around 3.5 days to complete the task. I took that extra time because I want to show how would I structure a project to make it scalable and ready for production. I had fun creating this project and I hope you appreciate the effort!

### Setup

```
yarn
yarn api
yarn start
```

### E2E Tests

I cover all the page requirements on the e2e test

```
yarn e2e
```

### Unit Tests

Since is MVP, I opted to test only the `merchantSelectors.ts` to show how would I do a unit test. but if it was a production scenario I would cover more cases.

```
yarn test
```
